## Installation information

It is recommended to install third-party software via Flatpak on the Steam Deck.
This can be done by searching for `Prism Launcher` in the Discover software center, in *Desktop Mode*.

After installing Prism Launcher, set it up as usual.
When you are done, open up Steam (still in *Desktop Mode*), click on `Games` in the menubar, and then click on `Add a Non-Steam Game to My Library...`.
There you can find and select `Prism Launcher` and click `ADD SELECTED PROGRAMS`.
Now Prism Launcher should be in your Steam Library.

### Artwork

Now that you have Prism Launcher in your Steam Library, you might want to change the artwork of your Prism Launcher Non-Steam Game, so that it looks better in your library.

#### Setting up Artwork

You first need to find artwork for Prism Launcher.
One option is to check out [Prism Launcher's SteamGridDB page](https://www.steamgriddb.com/game/5359069) for our official artwork, as well as community-provided artwork.
Alternatively, there also is a [SteamGridDB page of Minecraft](https://www.steamgriddb.com/game/38365).
In any case, select the artwork you'd like to use, and download it onto your Steam Deck.

First, we will set the **background** (also called "hero" on SteamGridDB) and the **logo**. In desktop mode, go to your steam library, and select the Prism Launcher Non-Steam Game. Right-click at the top, and select `Set Custom Background`.

Now, navigate to where you have saved the images, and select the background. I saved them in my Downloads folder, which will have the path of `/home/deck/Downloads`.
Then do the same thing for `Set Custom Logo`, and select the logo.

Additionally, you can change the **cover-art** (also called "grid" on SteamGridDB).
There are two types of cover-art, one is the normal vertical one, and the other is the wider one.

To change these, you should first start Prism Launcher through Steam, and close it again.
This way, you can now head over to your library, and right click Prism Launcher in the `RECENT GAMES` shelf.
It should be using a **wide cover** as it's the last-played game.
Now, right-click the cover, and select `Set custom artwork` under `Manage`.

Navigate to where you have saved the images, and select the **wide cover-art**.

Then start a different game, and close it, so that Prism Launcher is now the second game in the shelf (with a *vertical cover*).
Now, you can again, right-click the cover, and select `Set custom artwork` under `Manage`.

Navigate to where you have saved the images, and select the **vertical cover-art**.

Additionally, you can add an icon and rename the Non-Steam Game to Minecraft.
To do so, right-click on the Prism Launcher Non-Steam Game, and select `Properties`. At the top, you can rename PrismLauncher to Minecraft, and you can change the Icon by clicking the empty square that is to the left of the name, and then select the image you want to use.

### Tips and Tricks

- For the best experience, go ahead and enable `Start Minecraft maximized`, and `Close Prism Launcher after game window opens` in the launcher's settings, under the `Minecraft` tab.
- If you want Minecraft to launch without showing Prism Launcher, add `-l <instance-id>` in the launch options for your Prism Launcher Non-Steam Game. If you use this launch option, make sure that `Close Prism Launcher after game window opens` is disabled in the launcher's settings, so that the launcher does not show up when the game is closed. See [CLI launch options](../../wiki/getting-started/command-line-interface/) for more.
- Install a mod that enables controller support. See [Controller Support](../../wiki/getting-started/controller-support) for more.
