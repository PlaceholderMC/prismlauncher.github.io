          Install and launch modpacks easily, while keeping them clean.
          No longer do you need to manually install them, and updating feature is coming soon. Prism Launcher can do that for you, without installing tons of separate launchers.

          <p>Did your settings ever reset after launching an older version? Did you ever accidentally break a world because you opened it in an old version?
          Are you tired of manually switching mods for different versions, installing modloaders?<p>
          <p>Prism Launcher can help. Each Minecraft instance has its own folder, with separate mods, resourcepacks and other things.</p>

          You don't need an embedded web browser for a game launcher. Prism Launcher uses the Qt toolkit, which requires little system resources. Prism Launcher also supports customizing the instance window and theme.
