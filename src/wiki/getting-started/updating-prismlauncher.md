# Updating Prism Launcher

Updating Prism Launcher will depend a little on the method of installation you chose.

## Any kind of package management system

This includes Scoop, Chocolatey, winget, Homebrew, MacPorts, Flathub, `apk`, any AUR helper, `dnf`, `apt`, any MPR helper, Pacstall, the Pi-Apps store, `emerge`, `zypper`, and `xbps`.

For these, just let your package manager handle the update for you. Run the command to update packages through the package manager and you should be good to go!

## MacOS

Auto-updating is implemented with the Sparkle framework.

## Windows

We are currently working on an auto-update solution. In the meantime, just download the most recent installer and run it. This will preserve all of your instances.
