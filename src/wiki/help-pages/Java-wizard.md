In this page you can set the global Java settings.
For more information on how to manualy download and install java check the documentaion [found here](../getting-started/installing-java).
For more information about each java setting check the documentaion [found here](Java-settings).
We recommend that new users enable both the Autodetect and Auto-download Java features, in order not to need to manually set up their java path for each instance.
